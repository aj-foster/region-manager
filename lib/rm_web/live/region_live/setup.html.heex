      Setting up a new season requires re-inputting data in the <em>FIRST</em>
      Tech Challenge Cloud Scoring system. Region Manager makes this
      easier by first allowing you to choose what data (leagues, league assignments, etc.)
      should be copied from the previous season. Then it advises you on the differences between
      what Region Manager knows and what <em>FIRST</em>
      knows.

      Because this region does not have leagues, there isn't much to set up at the beginning of the
      season. Please contact an administrator if this region should have leagues in the new season.
